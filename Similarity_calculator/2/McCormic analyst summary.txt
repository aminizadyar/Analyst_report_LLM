Key Takeaways
Performance Beat Expectations: McCormick reported earnings of $0.57 for fiscal 3Q09, which beat the consensus estimate by $0.03. Revenue grew by 4.6% year-on-year (y/y), slightly above the 4.4% estimate. The gross margin of 40.3% was a bit lighter than expected but still improved by 70 basis points (bps) y/y. The primary driver of the beat came from cost savings in the SG&A line, reducing the SG&A margin by 40 bps y/y. Management raised its guidance to the top end of the $2.31-$2.33 range, excluding non-recurring items.

Clarification on Walmart and Pension Overhangs: McCormick provided clarity on two major concerns affecting the stock:

Pensions: The company expects a hit of $0.05 to $0.07 in fiscal year 2010 (FY10) due to pension liabilities, in line with J.P. Morgan’s forecast. However, there is potential risk to earnings from pensions beyond FY10.
Walmart: Walmart is conducting tests of shelf sets that are exclusively private label and others exclusively featuring McCormick's core spices/seasonings. If Walmart favors the latter test, it could benefit McCormick significantly under Project Impact.
Concerns About Organic Volume Growth: McCormick’s organic volume in its Consumer division declined by 2.4% y/y in 3Q09, marking the third consecutive decline. This occurred despite a deceleration in price growth. With pricing benefits decreasing and the acquisition of Lawry’s fully integrated, the company needs to focus on driving higher volumes, potentially requiring increased marketing spending.

Financial Performance
Revenues and Earnings Outlook:

For FY09, McCormick is expected to earn $2.33 per share, up from previous estimates of $2.30. For FY10, the company is forecasted to earn $2.49 per share, slightly higher than prior estimates of $2.46. By FY11, earnings are expected to increase further to $2.68.
Revenues are expected to grow from $3.20 billion in FY09 to $3.35 billion in FY10 and $3.53 billion in FY11.
Valuation and Price Target:

McCormick trades at 13.8 times the consensus next twelve months (NTM) EPS estimate, which trails the group average by about 0.8x. J.P. Morgan sees no reason for McCormick to trade at a premium to the group, but neither should it trade at a significant discount.
Applying the group average multiple of 14.6x to the FY11 EPS estimate of $2.68 results in a fair value of $39, which is now J.P. Morgan’s price target for December 2010. The previous price target of $34 was set for December 2009.
Risks and Opportunities
Upside Potential:

Walmart may choose to go 100% McCormick for core spices, which would boost sales.
An economic recovery could drive consumers to higher-margin, premium products.
The introduction of new products could outperform expectations, leading to higher-than-expected sales growth.
Downside Risks:

Walmart could opt for 100% private label spices, which would negatively impact McCormick’s sales.
Continued weakness in consumer spending could lead to lower sales of premium products.
New products may fail to gain traction, resulting in lower-than-anticipated growth.
Impact of Walmart Scenarios
100% McCormick Spices in Walmart: If Walmart decides to exclusively carry McCormick’s core spices and seasonings, J.P. Morgan estimates a positive impact of $0.04 to McCormick’s FY10 earnings per share (EPS).
100% Private Label Spices in Walmart: On the downside, if Walmart moves entirely to private label spices, McCormick’s FY10 EPS could take a $0.05 hit.
Conclusion
McCormick’s strong third-quarter performance and the clarification provided on key overhangs like pensions and Walmart are positive for the stock. However, concerns about declining organic volume growth and potential risks related to Walmart’s decisions limit the upside potential. As a result, J.P. Morgan reiterates its Neutral rating on the stock with a price target of $39 by December 2010.

Summary of Financials
McCormick’s financial outlook shows steady revenue and earnings growth through FY11. Key highlights from the income statement include:

FY09 Revenue: $3.20 billion
FY09 Operating EPS: $2.33
FY10 Revenue: $3.35 billion
FY10 Operating EPS: $2.49
The report reflects that while McCormick’s financial position remains strong, the future performance is dependent on how the company navigates risks related to Walmart’s strategic decisions and its ability to drive organic growth.
