1. Financial Performance Overview:
Revenue and Earnings: McCormick reported Q3 2009 revenues of $791.7 million, a slight decrease from the consensus of $802.85 million. However, normalized earnings per share (EPS) exceeded expectations at $0.57, compared to the forecasted $0.54, a 5.56% surprise. Despite the revenue decline, McCormick experienced a strong profit growth driven by pricing actions, cost reductions, and a favorable business mix, particularly from its acquisition of Lawry’s®.

In the Consumer business, operating income increased by 19%, while the Industrial segment saw an even higher growth of 34%. These increases were largely driven by volume and product mix improvements, pricing actions, and the cost management initiatives under McCormick's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased by 80 basis points, partly due to these factors, and the company's restructuring program further contributed to operating efficiencies.

Segment Performance: The Consumer segment achieved a 2% increase in net sales, translating to 6% growth in local currency. Lawry’s® was a significant contributor to this increase, along with pricing actions taken in late 2008 and early 2009. In the Americas, consumer sales grew 8%, with 9% growth in local currency. However, in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, sales declined by 13%, reflecting challenges in the retail environment, especially in the UK. In the Asia-Pacific region, consumer sales were down 4%, but local currency growth was 5%, driven by new product launches in China and expanded distribution.

The Industrial business saw a 1% rise in sales, or 7% in local currency, driven by pricing actions and favorable volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas increased by 4%, with contributions from new products for quick-service restaurants. In EMEA, industrial sales declined 10% but grew 8% in local currency, while the Asia-Pacific region saw a 6% growth in local currency sales, primarily from quick-service restaurant demand in China and Australia.

2. Cost Management and Operational Efficiencies:
Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) Program: McCormick’s CCI program was a key driver of cost reductions in Q3. This initiative helped improve gross profit margins and reduce selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses. The company achieved $2.4 million in cost savings from CCI during the quarter and is on track to exceed its $30 million savings target for 2009, expecting to reach $35 million by year-end.

SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased by 180 basis points, despite a 30 basis point increase in marketing expenses. McCormick’s management attributed this to operational efficiencies, cost control measures, and Lawry’s® integration, which was completed with minimal additional costs. The integration of Lawry’s® helped boost gross profit margins, and its marketing support contributed to incremental sales growth, particularly in the Americas.

Debt Reduction and Cash Flow Management: McCormick continued its focus on reducing debt, with net debt down by approximately $200 million from a year ago, largely from paying down debt related to the Lawry’s® acquisition. The company also demonstrated strong cash flow management, with operating cash flow reaching $195.1 million for the first three quarters, a significant $79.8 million increase year-over-year. The improvement was driven by higher net income and effective working capital management, including improved inventory turns and reduced days sales outstanding.

3. Outlook for Q4 2009 and Beyond:
Sales and Marketing Strategy: McCormick is optimistic about its performance heading into the fourth quarter, especially during the holiday season, which is a peak sales period for spices and seasonings. The company plans to increase its marketing efforts, with its largest-ever holiday campaign in the U.S., including TV, print, and interactive media promotions. It also plans to support its Simply Asia® and Zatarain’s® brands in the U.S., Vahiné® in France, and new product launches in China.

The company’s product innovation strategy is expected to drive future growth. Two new product lines, Perfect Pinch® and Recipe Inspirations™, will launch in 2010. Perfect Pinch® offers 18 seasoning blends, including salt-free options, while Recipe Inspirations™ provides pre-measured spices and herbs with recipe cards, targeting consumers looking for convenience and value.

Cost Projections for 2010: Looking ahead to 2010, McCormick expects continued growth despite potential headwinds from rising pension expenses. The company is evaluating its 2010 budget, with plans to further increase brand marketing and expand its CCI program. While pension expenses are expected to rise due to lower discount rates, the projected impact on EPS is anticipated to be in the $0.05 to $0.07 range.

The integration of Lawry’s® is complete, and McCormick is focusing on growth through product innovation, marketing, and expanded distribution in global markets. The company is confident that it can maintain its momentum into 2010 by capitalizing on changing consumer behavior, with more people eating at home during the economic downturn.

4. Key Challenges and Competitive Landscape:
Economic and Competitive Pressures: McCormick faced challenges in some regions, particularly in Europe, where the economic environment remains difficult. The company experienced sales declines in the UK, where consumer demand was weak, and in EMEA, where sales to foodservice operators slowed due to economic conditions. However, McCormick offset these challenges with strong performance in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, particularly through quick-service restaurant demand.

In the U.S., McCormick is contending with increased competition from private-label brands, particularly in the spice and seasoning category. The company is focused on maintaining its market share by offering value and convenience to consumers while managing pricing and promotions effectively to remain competitive.

Wal-Mart Private Label Test: One of the most discussed issues during the Q&A session was Wal-Mart’s decision to test a private-label spice solution in some stores. McCormick clarified that the impact of this test is expected to be minimal in the short term. The company emphasized its long-standing leadership in the spice category, driven by innovation, marketing, and superior merchandising, and expressed confidence that its strong relationship with Wal-Mart will continue to drive growth.

In summary, McCormick & Co. demonstrated strong performance in Q3 2009, driven by its cost management initiatives, successful integration of Lawry’s®, and focus on marketing and innovation. Despite challenges in certain regions, the company is well-positioned for growth in the fourth quarter and into 2010, with plans to continue expanding its product offerings and increasing its brand presence in key markets.
