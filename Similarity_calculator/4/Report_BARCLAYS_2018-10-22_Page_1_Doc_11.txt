EBIT growth at trough; Industry consolidation may be near at hand

Following Q3 earnings, we lower our EPS estimates, and our Price Target falls to $230 from $239. Tornado issues aside, we thought there were some points of encouragement for LII, particularly amidst what is an increasingly challenging demand backdrop for many Multi-Industry companies (per our report `Q3 Learnings from Earnings Part 1; October 22, 2018'). We note that the share price has now reached a point which it has `bounced off' on 4 other occasions this year, which may suggest a favorable entry point.

Top-line shortfall should reverse: LII sounded upbeat on the demand backdrop, noting that it had clearly lost share (due to the tornado) amidst a strong Resi market, and there were still several years left in the Replacement cycle in the US, while Commercial HVAC should re-accelerate in Q4. In Refrigeration, the market remains challenging, but LII seems to be out-growing its nearest competitor. We are watchful for signs that the housing weakness spills over into broader US construction / Buildings demand, but so far there is not much evidence of this.

Margin set-up is encouraging: Our view for some time now (HVAC Markets stand out amidst a rising industrial tide; August 9, 2018) has been that the HVAC OEMs should enjoy a margin tailwind in 2019 as price / cost becomes more favorable, and what we heard suggests that industry competitive discipline is supporting ongoing price increases, and the rising tariffs should not be an insurmountable headwind.

Consolidation prospects: Mr Bluedorn spent some time discussing HVAC consolidation on the earnings call; what we heard was consistent with what we have laid out in various reports since March (`LII ­ Winner amidst future consolidation; April 23, 2018' and `IR ­ CEO Meeting Takeaways; June 11, 2018'). We show inside updated LII-York Resi and LII-Carrier scenarios. We continue to think anti-trust is not a big hurdle to M&A among the Big 4 US OEMs, and await news from UTX and JCI regarding their portfolio reviews. We think LII is likely to be a net winner from consolidation.

Organic Sales
We estimate that when excluding the Tornado impact, LII grew organic sales ~6% in Q3, a slight deceleration from Q2. In Commercial, we expect growth to rebound in Q4, following a subdued Q3 performance (National Account lumpiness in North America, and Customer digestion of commercial unitary price increases associated with F Gas regulation in Europe).

HVAC Margins
The combination of solid volume demand, higher prices, and levelling out in input costs, should lead to a sharp recovery in HVAC profits over the next two years. We note that following the last period when profits were suppressed by inflation pressure (2011-2012), there then followed a very sharp rebound (2013). Consensus assumes no such profit acceleration in 2019, which we believe may prove conservative.

FIGURE 6 HVAC OEM profit growth should re-accelerate; consensus estimates for 2019+ may prove conservative if EBIT growth follows historical patterns

The combination of higher prices (from the carry-over of measures enacted in 2018) and lower input costs, could be a very powerful driver of higher gross margins for the HVAC industry in 2019.

HVAC Consolidation
LII provided considerable commentary on HVAC consolidation on the earnings call, which was broadly consistent with what we have written about throughout the year. For background, please see our initial report (`HVAC / F&S Consolidation; March 14, 2018') and our follow up in August (`HVAC Markets stand out amidst a rising industrial tide; August 9, 2018'). In the event that consolidation does occur but LII is not one of the involved parties, we think that it will likely win organic market share, particularly as some of its biggest rivals will be involved in a multi-year restructuring; if it is involved, we think most putative transactions are likely to be highly accretive and generate considerable synergies.
As Mr. Bluedorn pointed out (consistent with the point we made in March), the main catalyst for HVAC consolidation to occur now is that two of the larger global players, JCI and UTX, are both undertaking strategic portfolio reviews. We expect to hear the outcome of the JCI review by early November, and we expect to hear from UTX by mid-November, based on the timelines previously laid out by their management teams.
The rationales that LII cited for consolidation were consistent with what we had highlighted in our report following meetings with the Ingersoll CEO Mike Lamach (`IR ­ CEO Meeting Takeaways; June 11, 2018'), including:
 The need for continuous investment to drive up efficiency in HVAC products, to meet tighter environment standards;
 The growing importance of having strong controls offerings alongside traditional equipment;
 The increasing role of digital / information management / data analytics offerings;
 Traditional supplier / COGS savings from factory footprint and supplier consolidation;
 Savings from reduction of corporate and SG&A expenses.
We continue to think that anti-trust considerations are not a huge barrier to consolidation (something which Mr. Bluedorn also seems to be believe), and nor are differing distribution models (Mr. Bluedorn on this point noted that "in an industry like this, when you consolidate...there will be some period of time leaving distribution alone....I don't think you want to sort of go from one model to another model quickly").
We show below the positioning of the major players in the HVAC industry. Our understanding is that LII would prefer to stay focused on unitary HVAC, rather than move into the Applied world, in any meaningful way.

We show below where we see the biggest anti-trust risks facing HVAC consolidation among the Big 4 US players ­ transport refrigeration is the major such area, in our view (where LII does not participate).

LII ­ Carrier RMT Scenario
In response to a question on the call regarding consolidation with Carrier, the LII CEO noted "my guess is they could combine with us." As we highlighted in a recent report, `UTX ­ Press reports that UTX is exploring sale of Chubb F&S; September 24, 2018', UTX seems to be in the midst of divesting the non-HVAC parts of its CC&S division, which may render what is left of CC&S as easier to merge with a partner, or else list it separately as a standalone HVAC entity (similar to LII).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:

Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.

Stock Rating

Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.

Industry View

Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.

Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

U.S. Multi-Industry Allegion plc (ALLE) Dover Corporation (DOV)

Upside/downside scenarios, where provided, represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period. Top Picks: Barclays Equity Research's "Top Picks" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry (as defined by the relevant "industry coverage universe"), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes "Top Picks" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one "Top Pick" for each industry.
