1. Overview of the Financial Situation:
Revenue and Earnings: KB Home’s third-quarter revenues totaled $456 million, a 33% decline compared to Q3 2008, driven primarily by a 20% reduction in home deliveries and a 15% decrease in the average selling price (ASP) of homes. The average selling price of homes dropped to $202,800, partly due to competitive pressures and the introduction of lower-priced homes under KB Home’s new "Open Series" product line. Despite these challenges, the company improved its gross margin to 11.1% from 3.9% the prior year, thanks to cost reductions, operating efficiencies, and fewer inventory impairments. The net loss for the quarter was $66 million, or $0.87 per share, a significant improvement over the $145 million loss in Q3 2008.

Impairments and SG&A Costs: Inventory impairments for the quarter were reduced to $16 million from $39 million a year ago, indicating stabilization in the company’s inventory. KB Home also continued to control costs by lowering its selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses by 37% year-over-year, mainly by reducing workforce-related costs and other fixed expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of housing revenue dropped to 18.5%.

Cash Flow and Debt: KB Home ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and liquidity of $1.5 billion, which included available credit. The company generated $30 million in positive cash flow from operations during Q3. Despite increasing debt by $101 million (due to joint venture consolidations), KB Home remains committed to being cash-flow positive and reducing debt.

2. Strategic Initiatives:
Focus on First-Time Homebuyers: KB Home shifted its focus back to first-time homebuyers, who accounted for 80% of the company’s home deliveries in Q3 2009. This is a significant increase from 40% in 2006, before the housing downturn. The company’s new "Open Series" product line has been pivotal in this strategy, offering customizable homes at competitive price points aimed at first-time buyers, competing directly with resales and foreclosures.

Open Series™ Success: The "Open Series" homes have garnered positive feedback, with net orders rising 62% year-over-year in Q3, driven by strong demand across regions like California, Arizona, Las Vegas, and Florida. The Open Series accounted for a growing percentage of KB Home’s deliveries and helped boost gross margins despite pricing pressures. This product line is expected to make up more than 50% of deliveries in Q4 2009 and continue its growth into 2010.

Operational Efficiency Improvements: KB Home has made significant progress in reducing its build times. Since 2006, the company reduced the time to build a home by 50 days, a 35% reduction. This operational improvement allows the company to better compete with the resale market, offering new homes with faster delivery times. KB Home has also reduced construction costs and improved build-to-order flexibility, which enhances customer satisfaction and profitability.

3. Challenges in the Housing Market:
Market Uncertainty and Foreclosures: KB Home acknowledged that the housing market remained uncertain, with foreclosures and unemployment being the main drags on stability. The company expects foreclosures to continue inflating housing inventory, and employment insecurity to deter potential homebuyers. However, by staying competitive with resales and foreclosures, and offering lower monthly payments, KB Home aimed to attract price-sensitive buyers.

Regional Variations in Performance: Different regions showed varying levels of recovery, with California, Arizona, Las Vegas, and Florida still heavily impacted by foreclosures but demonstrating some signs of order growth. The West Coast performed better, with home deliveries down only 8% compared to the previous year, while the Central region saw a 5% increase in deliveries. In contrast, the Southeast and Southwest regions experienced sharper declines of 47% and 26%, respectively.

Tax Credit Influence: KB Home benefited from the federal first-time homebuyer tax credit, which stimulated demand in many markets, especially as 80% of KB Home’s buyers in Q3 were first-time buyers. However, the company anticipated a slowdown in sales as the expiration of the tax credit approached and was cautious about how the market would respond without this incentive.

4. Outlook and Strategic Adjustments:
Cautious Optimism for Recovery: While optimistic about long-term growth, KB Home remained cautious about the immediate future due to ongoing market uncertainty, particularly concerning unemployment and foreclosures. However, the company planned to continue focusing on operational efficiency, cost control, and strategic land acquisition to position itself for future growth.

Land Acquisition and Development: KB Home increased its land acquisition activity in Q3, securing finished lots in all regions. The company adopted a conservative approach, targeting lots that align with its product strategy and generate high returns. This focus on acquiring land with flexible, low-deposit options allows the company to conserve cash while expanding its growth platform.

Joint Ventures and Debt: KB Home continued to reduce its exposure to joint ventures, cutting its number of unconsolidated joint ventures from 30 to 16 over the past year. The company also reduced the debt held by its joint ventures by 61%. This strategy of reducing joint venture exposure is expected to continue in the coming quarters, further strengthening KB Home’s balance sheet.

In conclusion, KB Home’s Q3 2009 earnings call highlights the company’s successful adaptation to the challenges of the housing market through product innovation, cost control, and strategic land acquisitions. Despite the uncertain economic environment, the company remains focused on restoring profitability and positioning itself for future growth.
