Here are the key points from the KB Home Q3 2009 earnings call:

1. KB Home's business model is producing favorable results despite the uncertain housing market. The company has made progress on improving gross margins, reducing SG&A, and increasing sales rates.

2. Net orders rose 62% year-over-year, driven by the success of KB Home's new "Open Series" product line, which is designed to match the wants and needs of today's homebuyers at a competitive price.

3. Gross margins improved over 700 basis points year-over-year, as the Open Series homes became a larger percentage of deliveries and KB Home was able to reduce construction costs and gain operating efficiencies.

4. SG&A expenses declined 37% year-over-year as KB Home continued to identify ways to do more with less, though they still have more work to do in this area.

5. KB Home expects the early stages of a housing recovery to be uneven, with continued pressure from foreclosures and unemployment. The company is focused on staying competitive with foreclosures and resales through its Open Series product.

6. KB Home resumed land acquisition activity in Q3, primarily targeting finished lots with rolling options, as they see opportunities that meet their return hurdles. However, they remain patient and disciplined in their approach.

7. The company believes it is increasingly well-positioned to compete in the current housing market environment due to its balance sheet strength, focus on first-time buyers, and the success of the Open Series product.

Overall, KB Home is making progress in executing its strategic initiatives to restore profitability, though the housing market recovery remains uncertain. The company appears to be taking the right steps to optimize its operations for the current environment.
