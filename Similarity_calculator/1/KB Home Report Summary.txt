Key Highlights
Sales Slowdown in August: KBH experienced a slowdown in sales during August 2009, primarily due to the expiration of the $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Despite this, the overall demand for homes remained stable, and the report anticipates a positive year-over-year order growth of 8% in the fourth quarter. This projection is based on the housing market showing signs of stabilization.

Gross Margins Performance: KBH's third-quarter gross margins were impacted by an increase in warranty liabilities related to Chinese drywall issues in Florida homes. Despite this, KBH's gross margins, excluding charges, were reported at 15.9%, exceeding the estimated 13.0%. Looking forward, the company expects gross margins to expand further in the fourth quarter, with an estimated growth of 90 basis points (bps).

Land Spending and Reinvestment: KBH increased its land spending during the third quarter to approximately $90 million, but on a year-over-year basis, the company's total land spend is expected to decline from over $500 million in 2008 to $360 million in 2009. KBH's focus is on acquiring finished lots with flexible options and gradually reentering key markets such as Washington D.C.

Joint Venture Debt Reduction: KBH has made progress in reducing debt related to its joint ventures (JVs). The company ended the third quarter with $172 million invested in 16 JVs, with total JV debt decreasing to $562 million, down from $740 million in the second quarter.

Financial Performance
Quarterly Revenue: KBH's revenue for the third quarter of 2009 was $458.5 million, a 32.7% decline compared to the third quarter of 2008. However, KBH's gross profit improved significantly from $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2009 to $50.2 million in the third quarter, representing an 11.1% gross margin. This improvement in profitability is attributed to higher operational efficiencies and lower impairment charges.

Order Growth: KBH reported a 62% year-over-year increase in new home orders, which was well above the 20% growth estimate provided by J.P. Morgan. This growth was led by strong demand in the Southeast region, which saw a 124% increase in orders. The report also notes that the average selling price of KBH homes declined by 28% year-over-year due to a shift in product mix and value-engineering efforts in the company's Open Series communities.

Cash Position and Debt: While KBH's cash position decreased slightly from $1.10 billion in the second quarter to $1.06 billion in the third quarter, the company remains financially stable. However, its net debt-to-capital ratio increased to 55.2%, a 790-bps sequential rise. This increase is partly due to KBH reinvesting in its business, including its reentry into the Washington D.C. market.

Investment Outlook
Overweight Rating and Price Target: J.P. Morgan maintains an "Overweight" rating on KBH, with a price target of $25.50 by December 2010. The stock is trading at 0.97 times its price-to-book (P/B) ratio, a 9% discount to its larger-cap peers, which trade at 1.07 times P/B. The report cites KBH's value-engineering efforts, improving order growth, and solid cash position as factors supporting the bullish outlook.

Risks to the Investment Thesis: The report identifies several risks that could negatively impact KBH’s stock performance. These include weaker-than-expected order growth, higher-than-anticipated impairment charges, and lower-than-expected margins and sales benefits from its Open Series communities.

Valuation
Price Target Calculation: The price target of $25.50 is derived from applying a 1.66 times P/B multiple to KBH's estimated year-end 2010 book value of $16.75 (excluding FAS 109 charges). This multiple represents a 10% premium to KBH's historical 10-year average P/B multiple and reflects J.P. Morgan’s positive outlook for the housing market over the next 24 months.
Conclusion
KBH has shown improvements in key operational metrics during the third quarter of 2009, including gross margins, new orders, and debt reduction. While the company faces challenges due to the expiration of the tax credit and challenging market conditions, J.P. Morgan remains optimistic about KBH's long-term prospects, driven by its value-engineering efforts, positive order growth outlook, and stable cash position.
