PPG Industries, Inc.
3Q'18 in Line With Preannouncement

PPG reported 3Q'18 adj. EPS of $1.45, in-line with pre-announced range of $1.411.45 and ~5% lower than 3Q'17 adj. EPS of $1.52. PPG reiterated its 4Q'18 EPS expectations at $1.03-1.13. While the company expects normal business seasonality + global economic growth to remain positive overall, PPG did call out Industrial production volatility + inconsistency in emerging markets growth rates, which it does expect to continue through the remainder of the year. 3Q'18 revenues of ~$3.8B (+1%y/y) were also in line with PPG's preannouncement.

Pricing + Margins: PPG continues to push price increases (price has increased sequentially for six straight q's), but raw material + logistics cost inflation + negative FX continue to hamper margins. Overall operating margins compressed in both segments with Industrial Coatings falling ~400bps and Performance down ~150bps from last year. Many of the same pressures are expected to continue into 4Q with PPG projecting raw mat cost inflation increasing at the "low end of mid single-digit %" + freight and logistics increasing by a "mid-teen %". PPG does believe, however, that it can get close to margin parity by next quarter. Additional benefits could come from pulling forward restructuring savings + an easier 4Q comp from the raw material spike in 4Q'17 (driven by Chinese environmental reform).

China Commentary: PPG was helpful providing additional color around the soft Chinese demand commentary given in its 3Q preannouncement, explaining the company's belief that the current slowdown in auto OEM and general industrial should be transitory. Despite calling out lower consumer confidence stemming from trade tariffs, PPG did remain optimistic on after-market demand and architectural markets.

Capital Allocation: PPG has ~$1B earmarked in 4Q'18 for M&A and share buybacks. The company highlighted an "active" pipeline on its earnings call and our sense is that M&A could have a greater weighting than buybacks in the next quarter.

Our price target remains $109 or ~17x our 2019e EPS of $6.45 (unchanged).

Why Equal Weight? We believe PPG is well positioned

as a leading global paints and coatings producer with

a diverse yet focused end market and regional footprint driving above average growth. Valuation is what keeps us currently on the sidelines.

Upside case

USD 130.00

Our upside case of $130 is based on a ~20x forward

P/E multiple on our 2018E EPS of $6.45. This assumes

continued global economic growth and a sizable acceleration in underlying volume growth, coupled with stable energy and raw material costs.

Downside case

USD 85.00

Our downside case of $85 is based on a ~15x forward

P/E multiple on a bear case 2019 EPS estimate of

$5.50. This assumes the outlook on global economic growth and manufacturing costs becomes less favorable.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:

Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.

Stock Rating

Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.

Industry View

Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.

Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

U.S. Chemicals Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD) Celanese Corp. (CE)
