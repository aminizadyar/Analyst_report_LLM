PPG reported 3Q'18 adj. EPS of $1.45, in-line with pre-announced range of $1.411.45 and ~5% lower than 3Q'17 adj. EPS of $1.52. PPG reiterated its 4Q'18 EPS expectations at $1.03-1.13. While the company expects normal business seasonality + global economic growth to remain positive overall, PPG did call out Industrial production volatility + inconsistency in emerging markets growth rates, which it does expect to continue through the remainder of the year. 3Q'18 revenues of ~$3.8B (+1%y/y) were also in line with PPG's preannouncement.
Pricing + Margins: PPG continues to push price increases (price has increased sequentially for six straight q's), but raw material + logistics cost inflation + negative FX continue to hamper margins. Overall operating margins compressed in both segments with Industrial Coatings falling ~400bps and Performance down ~150bps from last year. Many of the same pressures are expected to continue into 4Q with PPG projecting raw mat cost inflation increasing at the "low end of mid single-digit %" + freight and logistics increasing by a "mid-teen %". PPG does believe, however, that it can get close to margin parity by next quarter. Additional benefits could come from pulling forward restructuring savings + an easier 4Q comp from the raw material spike in 4Q'17 (driven by Chinese environmental reform).
China Commentary: PPG was helpful providing additional color around the soft Chinese demand commentary given in its 3Q preannouncement, explaining the company's belief that the current slowdown in auto OEM and general industrial should be transitory. Despite calling out lower consumer confidence stemming from trade tariffs, PPG did remain optimistic on after-market demand and architectural markets.
Capital Allocation: PPG has ~$1B earmarked in 4Q'18 for M&A and share buybacks. The company highlighted an "active" pipeline on its earnings call and our sense is that M&A could have a greater weighting than buybacks in the next quarter.
Our price target remains $109 or ~17x our 2019e EPS of $6.45 (unchanged).

a diverse yet focused end market and regional footprint driving above average growth. Valuation is what keeps us currently on the sidelines.
Our upside case of $130 is based on a ~20x forward
continued global economic growth and a sizable acceleration in underlying volume growth, coupled with stable energy and raw material costs.
Our downside case of $85 is based on a ~15x forward
$5.50. This assumes the outlook on global economic growth and manufacturing costs becomes less favorable.
