1. Financial Performance Overview:
Sales and Earnings: PPG reported net sales of approximately $3.8 billion in Q3 2018. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.45. However, the company faced significant cost pressures, primarily due to inflation in raw materials and logistics. PPG experienced the highest cost inflation in two years during this quarter, with mid- to high-single-digit increases in raw materials and nearly 20% increases in logistics costs compared to Q3 2017.

Despite the challenges, the company made progress in increasing selling prices by more than 2%, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential improvements. Total sales volumes were flat but would have increased by 2% excluding the impact of U.S. architectural coatings assortment changes.

Currency Impact: Foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by $80 million and pretax income by $15 million due to a stronger U.S. dollar against key currencies.

2. Segment Performance:
Performance Coatings Segment: Aerospace coatings delivered strong volume growth (over 10%), particularly in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. In EMEA, architectural coatings sales saw low single-digit growth due to higher prices, although volumes decreased in the Americas and Asia Pacific. The Mexican business, PPG-Comex, continued its expansion, adding 40 stores during the quarter. Protective and marine coatings also performed well, with protective coating sales growing in Asia.

Automotive refinish coatings saw a low single-digit decline in organic sales, with demand weakening in the U.S. and Europe due to customer inventory buildup. PPG managed to add a net of 3,000 body shops to its portfolio in 2018.

Industrial Coatings Segment: The industrial coatings segment achieved mid-single-digit sales volume growth, driven by packaging coatings. The automotive OEM coatings segment saw flat sales volumes, with growth in the U.S. offsetting declines in China, where sales were negatively impacted by a 12% drop in automotive production in September 2018.

Regional Performance: Emerging regions, especially Asia Pacific and Latin America, showed the highest sales growth, driven by strong performance in aerospace and industrial coatings. Sales in China slowed as the quarter progressed due to lower consumer spending. In Europe, sales volumes were flat.

3. Cost Management and Price Increases:
Raw Material and Logistics Costs: PPG faced mid- to high-single-digit raw material cost inflation, driven by higher oil prices and increased costs for epoxy resins, solvents, and other raw materials. The logistics cost increase of nearly 20% was attributed to higher transportation costs and driver shortages, a global issue. The company implemented price increases to counter these cost pressures, securing more than 2% price hikes year-over-year and expecting further increases in Q4.

PPGâ€™s restructuring programs contributed about $20 million in cost savings in Q3, with additional savings expected in Q4.

Capital Deployment: PPG deployed $1.3 billion in share repurchases in 2018, reducing diluted shares outstanding by 6% year-over-year. The company also benefited from a lower tax rate (21% in Q3 2018 versus 24% in Q3 2017) due to U.S. tax reform and favorable tax items. PPG plans to deploy a minimum of $1 billion in Q4 on acquisitions and share repurchases, with a focus on growth initiatives.

4. Outlook for Q4 2018 and 2019:
Challenges and Projections: The company expects global industrial demand to remain volatile, especially in emerging regions like China, where consumer confidence has been impacted by trade tensions. Automotive production in China is projected to grow by only 2% to 3% in 2019. In the U.S., economic activity is expected to continue at the same pace as in Q3, with stable automotive OEM builds. However, automotive refinish sales volumes could be affected by customer inventory adjustments.

PPG anticipates the year-over-year raw material inflation rate to moderate in Q4 as 2017 inflationary trends begin to cycle out. However, logistics costs are expected to remain elevated. The company has secured further price increases for Q4 to offset these costs.

Strategic Focus: PPG is focused on maintaining price discipline, expanding its product offerings, and managing costs to improve profitability. The company is confident that it will close the gap between price increases and raw material costs by Q4 or early 2019. PPG is also targeting growth in its aerospace, protective, and marine coatings businesses, which are expected to see continued improvement in the coming quarters.

In conclusion, PPG Industries faced significant cost pressures in Q3 2018 but managed to offset some of these challenges through price increases and cost savings initiatives. The company is optimistic about its growth prospects in key segments, particularly aerospace, while remaining cautious about potential volatility in the global market.
