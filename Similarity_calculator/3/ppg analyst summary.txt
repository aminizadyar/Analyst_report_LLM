Key Highlights
Third Quarter Performance: PPG reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.45 for 3Q’18, which is in line with its preannouncement range of $1.41 to $1.45. This figure is approximately 5% lower than the 3Q’17 adjusted EPS of $1.52. PPG reiterated its guidance for 4Q’18, projecting an EPS between $1.03 and $1.13. Revenues for 3Q’18 stood at $3.8 billion, up 1% year-on-year (y/y), in line with the preannouncement.

Challenges in Margins: The company has implemented price increases for six consecutive quarters, but rising costs for raw materials, logistics, and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts continue to pressure margins. In 3Q’18, the Industrial Coatings segment saw margins fall by approximately 400 basis points (bps), while the Performance Coatings segment experienced a decline of around 150 bps compared to the previous year. PPG expects continued cost inflation in the fourth quarter, with raw material inflation projected to increase in the low end of the mid-single-digit percentage range and freight and logistics costs increasing by mid-teen percentages.

Outlook for Margins: Despite these cost pressures, PPG believes it can achieve near-margin parity by the fourth quarter. The company expects benefits from ongoing restructuring savings and easier comparisons with 4Q’17, which saw a raw material price spike driven by Chinese environmental reforms.

China Market: PPG highlighted a slowdown in Chinese demand, particularly in the auto original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and general industrial sectors. However, the company expects the slowdown to be temporary. Despite lower consumer confidence due to trade tariffs, PPG remains optimistic about aftermarket demand and growth in the architectural coatings market in China.

Capital Allocation: PPG has earmarked $1 billion for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and share buybacks in 4Q’18. The company emphasized an active pipeline for M&A opportunities, which could outweigh share buybacks in the upcoming quarter.

Financial Overview
EPS Performance:

2017: $5.89 (actual)
2018: $5.91 (estimated)
2019: $6.45 (estimated)
The consensus numbers show growth in EPS from 2017 to 2019, with the company’s projected 2019 EPS reaching $6.45.

Price Target: Barclays maintains a price target of $109, representing a 7.5% upside from the stock’s current price of $101.39 as of October 19, 2018. The price target is based on a 17x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio applied to the 2019 EPS estimate.

Valuation and Market Position
PPG is a leading global paints and coatings producer with a diverse portfolio. Despite its strong market position, Barclays maintains an "Equal Weight" rating, citing valuation concerns. The company is well-positioned for above-average growth in its end markets, but the stock’s valuation keeps Barclays neutral.

Upside Case: Barclays projects a potential upside price target of $130 based on a 20x forward P/E ratio, assuming continued global economic growth and improved volume growth.

Downside Case: A downside price target of $85 is also projected, based on a 15x forward P/E multiple, if global economic growth slows and cost pressures rise.

Risks to Target Achievement
A further slowdown in top-line growth, spikes in raw material costs, and currency headwinds could impede PPG’s ability to meet its price target.
Conclusion
PPG Industries remains a strong player in the global paints and coatings market, but rising input costs and market volatility, particularly in emerging markets like China, continue to challenge its profitability. While Barclays remains optimistic about PPG’s market position and long-term prospects, the current valuation limits its potential upside, leading to the "Equal Weight" rating.
