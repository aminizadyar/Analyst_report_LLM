IQVIA
Seeing Positive Leading Indicators for 2019 in a Solid Quarter

Despite the muted stock reaction for IQVIA following earnings, we thought there were several encouraging leading indicators with 3Q18 results that bode well for growth heading into 2019. First, in R&D Solutions, IQVIA delivered a quarterly contracted book-to-bill of 1.69x (and ~1.4x on a TTM basis). Given IQVIA's scale in clinical development, the sheer magnitude of new business awards in the quarter was encouraging. Second, underlying organic growth in the R&D segment improved in the quarter on more difficult comps. After adjusting for the impact of ASC 606, we estimate net organic growth was ~7% (vs headline organic of 3.5%). Third, in the Technology & Analytics Solutions segment, IQVIA's OCE strategy appears to be resonating as it approaches a renewal cycle with biopharma sponsors. For the quarter itself, 6% CER revenue growth translated into 9% cash EBITDA growth and 20% cash EPS growth ­ highlighting the leverage inherent in IQVIA's business model. Folding these factors together, we believe IQVIA is well positioned heading into 2019 to continue delivering on its growth objectives. We reiterate our Overweight rating, and raise our price target to $140 (from $130).

Observations: 1) We believe the highlight of IQVIA's 3Q18 earnings was the company's contracted quarterly book-to-bill of 1.69x, and 1.38x on a TTM basis. 2) Looking at IQVIA's underlying results in R&D Solutions, we estimate organic growth improved to around 7% in 3Q18 under ASC-605. 3) Adjusted revenues of $2.594 billion were 0.8% above our estimate. 4) IQVIA is raising its earnings forecast for 2018 in conjunction with the better 3Q18 results. 5) Cash EBITDA of $561 million came in 2.1% above our expectation of $550 million. 6) COGS decreased by 90bps y/y and core SG&A (excomp) was down 270bps y/y. 7) Cash EPS of $1.42 came in $0.03 above our estimate and the Street at $1.39. 8) Cash flow from operations was positive at $344 million.

Why Overweight? We believe IQVIA has created a

best in class platform in the CRO industry. We believe

marrying Quintiles CRO platform with IMS' clinical insights will yield market share gains over time, and above-market organic growth. Additionally,

transaction cost synergies give us improved visibility

into earnings growth through 2020.

Upside case

USD 160.00

We believe the IQVIA value proposition could yield market share gains over time, coupled with a long runway for cost synergies. Our upside case of $160 represents 17x our upside 2019 adj. EBITDA of $2.55 billion.

Downside case

USD 80.00

Risks around M&A integration and recent growth trends in the Integrated Engagement Solutions business could weigh on near-term growth. Our downside case of $80 represents 13x our downside 2019 adj. EBITDA of $2.1 billion.

Introduction
Despite the muted stock reaction for IQVIA following earnings, we thought there were several encouraging leading indicators with 3Q18 results that bode well for growth heading into 2019. First, in R&D Solutions, IQVIA delivered a quarterly contracted bookto-bill of 1.69x (and ~1.4x on a TTM basis). Given IQVIA's scale in clinical development, the sheer magnitude of new business awards in the quarter was encouraging. Second, underlying organic growth in the R&D segment improved in the quarter on more difficult comps. After adjusting for the impact of ASC 606, we estimate net organic growth was ~7% (vs headline organic of 3.5%). Third, in the Technology & Analytics Solutions segment, IQVIA's OCE strategy appears to be resonating as it approaches a renewal cycle with biopharma sponsors. For the quarter itself, 6% CER revenue growth translated into 9% cash EBITDA growth and 20% cash EPS growth ­ highlighting the leverage inherent in IQVIA's business model. Folding these factors together, we believe IQVIA is well positioned heading into 2019 to continue delivering on its growth objectives. We reiterate our Overweight rating, and raise our price target to $140 (from $130).
Actions
We raise our price target to $140 (from $130), given increased conviction in the underlying growth trajectory for 2019. Our $140 PT represents 17x 2019 adj. EBITDA of $2.3 billion. Our prior $130 price target represented 16x our 2019 adj. EBITDA forecast of $2.3 billion. IQVIA's recent new business wins have out-paced peers, and we believe the NextGen strategy supports our view on 2019 growth. Specifically, IQVIA delivered a quarterly contracted book-to-bill of 1.69x (TTM of ~1.38x), which we believe improves visibility into R&D Solutions growth into 2019.
Observations
1) We believe the highlight of IQVIA's 3Q18 earnings was the company's contracted quarterly book-to-bill of 1.69x, and 1.38x on a TTM basis ­ which screens as higher than the company's peer group. IQVIA continues to show progress on its strategy to develop a "Next Generation CRO," with CEO Ari Bousbib highlighting $2.9 billion of awards (up from $2.3 billion in 2Q18) attributed to the offering. We believe the first incremental new business awards that the company won as part of the NextGen data capabilities are now starting to contribute more meaningfully to growth. Importantly, not only are the company's NextGen data capabilities helping to win business with existing clients, but IQVIA is gaining traction with new customers. In addition, the company is encouraged by wins it has achieved by leveraging the NextGen platform with smaller biopharma customers, a client base where IQVIA has historically been underpenetrated. The company noted that it saw just under 90% growth y/y in gross bookings with emerging biopharma customers, with the NextGen offering playing an important part in this. The company believes its NextGen offering is impacting roughly 50% of the company's RFP volume. Of this NextGen volume, the company is expanding its use of fixed price contracts.

2) Looking at IQVIA's underlying results in R&D Solutions, we estimate organic growth improved to around 7% in 3Q18 under ASC 605 ­ and that headline results understate the company's momentum. Given new business wins of $1.7 billion, and a quarterly bookto-bill of 1.69x, underlying net revenues for the R&D segment were around $1 billion in the quarter. This implies that underlying organic growth for the segment was 7%, vs headline organic growth of 3.5%. As background, under ASC-606, the CROs must include reimbursed pass-through expenses as part of gross revenues (historically they were netted out). In 3Q18, IQVIA faced a difficult y/y comparison on pass-through expenses.

3) Adjusted revenues of $2.594 billion were 0.8% above our estimate of $2.574 billion, and toward the upper end of the range of management guidance of $2.55-$2.60 billion. Currency neutral growth of 6.3% was 140bps above our estimate. FX was an 110bp headwind to revenue growth, 60bps more adverse than our model. From a segment perspective, results in Technology & Analytics Solutions drove the beat ­ while the remaining segments were relatively in line with expectations.
 R&D Solutions: Revenue of $1,382 million grew 3.5% y/y in constant currency, a moderation from 8.3% growth in 2Q18 and 5.8% in 1Q18. This was roughly consistent with our forecast for 4% gross organic growth. Management noted that segment growth was substantially all organic. The company did not detail the contribution from reimbursed expenses in the quarter, so we await the call for more details. Reimbursed expenses represented a $57mm headwind to R&D Solutions growth y/y in our model for 3Q18. Total revenue increased 3.1% and included a 40bp headwind from FX. Revenues came in 1.4% below our forecast of $1,401 million.
 Technology & Analytics Solutions: Revenue of $1,014 million grew 15.0% y/y constant currency, and up 12.9% including a 210bp headwind from FX. This came in 4.1% above our forecast of $974 million, with constant currency growth beating by 600bps (we modelled 9.0%). On the call, the company noted that organic growth was 4% during the quarter, implying an 11% benefit from M&A. Bousbib added that IQVIA is seeing early success with its Orchestrated Clinical Engagement (OCE) offering, winning 15 of its first 20 pitches.
 Contract Sales & Medical Solutions: Revenue of $198 million was -11.9% at constant currency, improving from -15.1% in 2Q18 and -12.8% in 1Q18. Overall growth declined 12.8% and included a 90bp headwind from FX. Organic growth was largely in line (10bp above) with our forecast of -12.0%, with revenues modestly below our estimate of $199 million due to FX.

4) IQVIA is raising its earnings forecast for 2018 in conjunction with the better 3Q18 results. Revenue is expected in the range of $10.30-$10.35 billion, up 6.2-6.7% y/y. Despite a greater than previously anticipated foreign exchange headwind for 2018, IQVIA is maintaining its revenue guidance at the midpoint, though is narrowing the range (from $10.25-$10.40 billion). Cash EBITDA is now forecast in the range of $2.195-$2.225 billion, up $10mm at the midpoint from the prior range of $2.170-$2.230 billion and

compared to our forecast of $2.2 billion. Similarly, Cash EPS is now forecast in a range of $5.45-$5.55, representing 20-22% growth. This is also up from the prior range of $5.35$5.55, which represented 17-22% growth y/y and compared to our forecast of $5.45. This included a projected 23% adjusted book tax rate, and 17% cash tax. The company noted that it completed $133 million of repurchase in the quarter, and has $889 million of authorization remaining.

6) COGS decreased by 90bps y/y and core SG&A (ex-comp) was down 270bps y/y. As a reminder, the merger between IMS Health and Quintiles was completed on October 3, 2016, so IQVIA has now annualized the mix benefits of IMS Health's attractive margin profile. On gross margins, similar to EBITDA, we expect that volume leverage and efficiency initiatives were partially offset by investments and FX headwinds.

7) Cash EPS of $1.42 came in $0.03 above our estimate and the Street at $1.39. Revenue came in 0.9% above our estimate. The upside in the quarter was driven by top-line leverage and slightly lower expenses, while the share count was relatively in line with our forecast.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:

Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.

Stock Rating

Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.

Industry View

Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.

Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

U.S. Life Science Tools & Diagnostics Agilent Technologies (A) Charles River Laboratories (CRL)

Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) Genomic Health Inc. (GHDX)

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target: Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided, represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period. Top Picks: Barclays Equity Research's "Top Picks" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry (as defined by the relevant "industry coverage universe"), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes "Top Picks" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one "Top Pick" for each industry. To view the current list of Top Picks, go to the Top Picks page on Barclays Live (https://live.barcap.com/go/keyword/TopPicks).

Valuation Methodology: Our Price Target of $140 represents 17x our adj. CY2019 EBITDA estimate of $2.3 billion.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: There are risks around talent retention from merging the two organizations. IQVIA's Integrated Engagement Solutions segment has weighed on growth trends, though the longer-term outlook continues to be promising. FX tailwinds have masked that underlying margin leverage at legacy Quintiles has been weak over the past two years.
