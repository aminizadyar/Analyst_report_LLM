Key Highlights:
Strong Quarterly Performance: IQVIA delivered a quarterly contracted book-to-bill ratio of 1.69x, higher than expected, with a trailing twelve-month (TTM) book-to-bill of ~1.4x. This was considered a significant positive indicator for future growth, as it reflected strong demand for IQVIA’s services, particularly in clinical development and R&D solutions.

Organic Growth in R&D Solutions: IQVIA’s organic growth in its R&D Solutions segment improved to around 7% for the quarter, after adjusting for the impact of accounting standard changes (ASC 606), versus a headline growth of 3.5%. The report notes that this growth came on top of difficult comparisons from the prior year, further emphasizing the strength in the segment.

Technology & Analytics Solutions: IQVIA’s Orchestrated Clinical Engagement (OCE) strategy appeared to be gaining traction with biopharma sponsors, and it was approaching a renewal cycle. The report highlights early success in IQVIA’s OCE offering, which has been a key driver in winning new business with smaller biopharma clients, a historically underpenetrated market for IQVIA.

Financial Metrics:

Revenue: IQVIA reported adjusted revenue of $2.594 billion, which was 0.8% above Barclays' estimate. Revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 6.3%, with a 9% increase in cash EBITDA and 20% growth in cash EPS for the quarter.
EPS: IQVIA posted cash EPS of $1.42, which was $0.03 higher than Barclays' estimate and above the consensus of $1.39. The company also raised its earnings forecast for 2018 based on better-than-expected 3Q results.
2019 Outlook:
Barclays remains optimistic about IQVIA’s growth trajectory heading into 2019, citing positive leading indicators such as the solid book-to-bill ratio and the company’s ability to secure new business awards. This optimism prompted Barclays to increase its price target for IQVIA to $140 from the previous $130, reflecting confidence in IQVIA’s ability to sustain its growth momentum.

Price Target and Stock Rating: Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on IQVIA with a 10.3% potential upside based on the stock’s price of $126.89 at the time of the report. The price target increase was supported by the firm’s positive view on IQVIA’s R&D Solutions growth and the leverage inherent in its business model.

Risks and Considerations:
Tariff Headwinds: The report briefly mentions that IQVIA, like many global companies, faces challenges from foreign exchange and potential tariff impacts, though the company’s focus on higher-margin solutions should help mitigate some of these risks.
Conclusion:
Barclays believes that IQVIA is well-positioned to deliver on its growth objectives in 2019, with solid organic growth in its R&D and Technology & Analytics Solutions segments, combined with strong financial performance. The firm remains bullish on IQVIA’s long-term prospects due to its ability to leverage its NextGen data capabilities and expand into new customer segments, particularly with smaller biopharma companies.
