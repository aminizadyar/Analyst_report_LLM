1- I need to find around 20 files and conduct the similarity exercise.

2- I must work with other institution's data to see whether getting company name is easy or not.

3- Investigate the analysis. see whether it is correct or not.

5- clean the analysis column. the amount of data in analyst reports can be reduced by 70%. I suspect after that, there is no need for summarizing the text. Each institution has its own layout. I think it can be done in a week. (I think I just need to delete everything that comes after analyst certification)(perhaps for every institution it is different)

6- after getting earnings call transcripts: the earnings call transcripts: I must extract the text only. the charts or the tables must be omitted. (I believe everything after presentation and before copyright must be kept)

7- I must deploy the project on AWS

8- I can train a model to predict future returns by the embeddings of analyst reports. I may want to condition on firm characteristics or other variables. To interpret, I can generate a set of themes that are usually discussed in analyst reports. and analyze the predicted returns of each.


=======================
Voyage AI has good documentation on embeddings.
