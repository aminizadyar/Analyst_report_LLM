Thereafter, the business model could be worked out.\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cKazuyo Katsuma, CPA (81-3) 6736-8612 kazuyo.katsuma@jpmorgan.com\\r\\n\\r\\nAsia Pacific Equity Research 01 March 2006\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies Recommended in This Report (as of COB 28 February 2006) Dwango (3715) (3715.T/¥265,000/Neutral)\\r\\nAnalyst Certification The research analyst who is primarily responsible for this research and whose name is listed first on the front cover certifies (or in a case where multiple research analysts are primarily responsible for this research, the research analyst named first in each group on the front cover or named within the document individually certifies, with respect to each security or issuer that the research analyst covered in this research) that: (1) all of the views expressed in this research accurately reflect his or her personal views about any and all of the subject securities or issuers; and (2) no part of any of the research analyst\\'s compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views expressed by the research analyst in this research.\\r\\nImportant Disclosures:\\r\\n\\r\\nDwango (3715) (3715.T) Price Chart\\r\\n\\r\\n1,190,400\\r\\n992,000\\r\\n793,600 Price(Y)\\r\\n595,200\\r\\n\\r\\nDate\\r\\n\\r\\nRating Share Price Price Target\\r\\n\\r\\n(Y)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Y)\\r\\n\\r\\n13-Dec-04 UW 464000\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\r\\n\\r\\n27-Feb-06 N\\r\\n\\r\\n272000\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\r\\n\\r\\nUW\\r\\n\\r\\nN\\r\\n\\r\\n396,800\\r\\n\\r\\n198,400\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nJul\\r\\n\\r\\nOct\\r\\n\\r\\nJan Apr\\r\\n\\r\\nJul\\r\\n\\r\\nOct\\r\\n\\r\\nJan Apr\\r\\n\\r\\nJul\\r\\n\\r\\nOct\\r\\n\\r\\nJan\\r\\n\\r\\n03\\r\\n\\r\\n03\\r\\n\\r\\n04\\r\\n\\r\\n04\\r\\n\\r\\n04\\r\\n\\r\\n04\\r\\n\\r\\n05\\r\\n\\r\\n05\\r\\n\\r\\n05\\r\\n\\r\\n05\\r\\n\\r\\n06\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: Reuters and JPMorgan; price data adjusted for stock splits and dividends.

media for mobile (emm) site, and is not limited to just a pooling of subscribers and the supply of ring songs. we like the deal\\'s potential, but we maintain our estimates and rating until we have more details on the business model.\\r\\n· business model announcement likely to come around next earnings results briefing: the company said the latest deal, which started brewing in the winter, is at the stage at which resources are being shared and business model ideas are being generated by using counterparty resources. management intends to provide details on the business model and services around the time of the next earnings announcement.\\r\\n· whether other companies participate in emm efforts to be a key issue: in addition to avex, we think other ring song suppliers, partners for packet radio and other content, and equity affiliate tower records japan could become involved in the effort to develop a comprehensive emm site. we see the extent of this participation as a determinant of whether dwango can benefit from first-mover advantages.\\r\\n\\r\\njapan internet\\r\\n\\r\\nkazuyo katsuma, cpa\\r\\n(81-3) 6736-8612 kazuyo.katsuma@jpmorgan.com\\r\\n\\r\\nmarket

march 2006\\r\\nissues concerning emm project\\r\\nas we see it, the partnership with avex is consistent with dwango\\'s goal with iromelo mix, namely a comprehensive mobile entertainment site for teenagers and young adults.\\r\\nthe company has so far tried to attract users with not only ring tones and ring songs but also packet radio, iro-melo games, and iro-melo potato, and also forged an equity partnership with tower records japan.\\r\\nwe believe the comprehensive partnership came about in part because avex has core customers who are similar to dwango\\'s and it was attracted to dwango\\'s ability to attract and retain mobile subscribers and its system strengths.\\r\\ndwango said the two companies are now at the stage where they are taking stock of each other\\'s assets, exchanging ideas on new possibilities that would result from a sharing of resources, and developing a business model and specific numerical targets.\\r\\nwe see two issues with the emm idea:\\r\\n(1) whether first-mover advantages can be sustained through prompt, steadfast execution specifically, one issue is whether dwango, with much expertise, can establish the services while it still has first-mover advantages, and thereby substantially boost profitability.\\r\\nto generate synergies, such as by transferring the ip assets of avex\\'s mu-mo official docomo site to dwango and establishing mutual site links between mu-mo and iromelo mix, we think the companies need to get down to the steadfast execution stage.\\r\\n(2) whether dwango can enlist content providers other than avex to protect participants\\' interests a second issue is whether dwango can enlist content providers other than avex without a clash of interests among participants so as to attract a broader range of content and make the emm site more appealing to subscribers.\\r\\nwe think it would be desirable to establish an arrangement whereby major shareholder avex and various close partners, including toshiba emi, fm tokyo, and tower records, which find the emm concept appealing, are able to participate in a win-win fashion.\\r\\nwe thus see these two issues, the pace of getting to the execution stage, and expanded content as keys to whether the emm idea will catch on with subscribers. thereafter, the business model could be worked out.\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0ckazuyo katsuma, cpa
