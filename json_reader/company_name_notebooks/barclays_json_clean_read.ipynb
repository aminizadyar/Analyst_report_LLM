       "  'Content': 'Toyota Boshoku\\r\\nShares seem to factor in excessive expectations; maintain our UW rating\\r\\n\\r\\n1H preview: We project 1H FY3/15 OP of JPY12.5bn, a 23% YoY decline. Our estimate exceeds the company\\'s JPY9bn target by JPY3.5bn, mainly due to volume upside and improved mix for domestic business and profit boosts from one-time items. The anticipated JPY2.3bn QoQ drop by OP to JPY5.1bn in 2Q (from 1Q\\'s JPY7.4bn) reflects removal of 1Q\\'s one-time items and sluggishness in the Americas region.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull-year FY3/15 estimates: We expect FY3/15 OP of JPY27bn, a 6% YoY decline. This view is in line with the company\\'s target and foresees improved product mix in Japan offsetting shortfalls from a delay by profit recovery in the Americas and a mix downturn in Asia. By region, we envision 1) a 45% YoY profit increase for Japan as contributions from lucrative products for Harrier, Voxy/Noah, and other vehicles more than compensate for lower volume; 2) modest expansion of the deficit for the Americas because of higher fixed costs and delayed income recovery in Mexico; 3) a 21% YoY profit decline for Asia & Oceania due to less-favorable product mix from a shift to compact vehicles; and 4) a slightly larger deficit for Europe & Africa due to an impact from aligning subsidiary fiscal years.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestment opinion: We think 1Q\\'s JPY7.4bn in OP incorporated more than one billion yen of one-time profit boosts, and these impacts are disappearing from 2Q. We expect 1H profit to exceed guidance because of domestic upside, but anticipate a shortfall in 2H, versus the plan\\'s JPY18bn OP target, due to less favorable mix in Asia and a delayed income recovery in the Americas. We believe the JPY29.5bn Reuters consensus estimate for FY3/15 OP factors in excessive expectations based on the robust 1Q outcome. We think full-fledged share-price gains will have to wait for confirmation of 1) improved product mix in Asia & Oceania and 2) income recoveries in the Americas and Europe & Africa, and we reiterate our UW rating.\\r\\n\\r\\n3116.T: Financial and Valuation Metrics EPS JPY\\r\\n\\r\\nFY Mar\\r\\n\\r\\n2013\\r\\n\\r\\n2014\\r\\n\\r\\nEPS\\r\\n\\r\\n85.27A\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevious EPS\\r\\n\\r\\n85.27A\\r\\n\\r\\nConsensus EPS\\r\\n\\r\\n85.23A\\r\\n\\r\\nP/E\\r\\n\\r\\n13.6\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: Barclays Research.

       "  'Analysis': 'Shares seem to factor in excessive expectations; maintain our UW rating\\n1H preview: We project 1H FY3/15 OP of JPY12.5bn, a 23% YoY decline. Our estimate exceeds the company\\'s JPY9bn target by JPY3.5bn, mainly due to volume upside and improved mix for domestic business and profit boosts from one-time items. The anticipated JPY2.3bn QoQ drop by OP to JPY5.1bn in 2Q (from 1Q\\'s JPY7.4bn) reflects removal of 1Q\\'s one-time items and sluggishness in the Americas region.\\nFull-year FY3/15 estimates: We expect FY3/15 OP of JPY27bn, a 6% YoY decline. This view is in line with the company\\'s target and foresees improved product mix in Japan offsetting shortfalls from a delay by profit recovery in the Americas and a mix downturn in Asia. By region, we envision 1) a 45% YoY profit increase for Japan as contributions from lucrative products for Harrier, Voxy/Noah, and other vehicles more than compensate for lower volume; 2) modest expansion of the deficit for the Americas because of higher fixed costs and delayed income recovery in Mexico; 3) a 21% YoY profit decline for Asia & Oceania due to less-favorable product mix from a shift to compact vehicles; and 4) a slightly larger deficit for Europe & Africa due to an impact from aligning subsidiary fiscal years.\\nInvestment opinion: We think 1Q\\'s JPY7.4bn in OP incorporated more than one billion yen of one-time profit boosts, and these impacts are disappearing from 2Q. We expect 1H profit to exceed guidance because of domestic upside, but anticipate a shortfall in 2H, versus the plan\\'s JPY18bn OP target, due to less favorable mix in Asia and a delayed income recovery in the Americas. We believe the JPY29.5bn Reuters consensus estimate for FY3/15 OP factors in excessive expectations based on the robust 1Q outcome. We think full-fledged share-price gains will have to wait for confirmation of 1) improved product mix in Asia & Oceania and 2) income recoveries in the Americas and Europe & Africa, and we reiterate our UW rating.\\nMarket Cap (JPY mn) Shares Outstanding (mn) Free Float (%) 52 Wk Avg Daily Volume (mn) Dividend Yield (%) Return on Equity TTM (%) Current BVPS (JPY)\\nJapan Autos & Auto Parts Takafumi Miura +81 3 4530 2924 takafumi.miura@barclays.com BSJL, Tokyo\\nBarclays Capital Inc. and/or one of its affiliates does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.

       "'total\\r\\nstronger than expected downstream\\r\\n\\r\\nfollowing today\\'s trading statement, we have increased our 3q net income estimates by 5%. this primarily relates to better than expected indicator refining margins offset in part by weaker liquids realisations upstream and as a result our full year estimates are up 1%. we now expect 3q net income of us$3.3bn, down 9% y/y but 4% higher than 2q. upstream, we forecast volumes down 7% y/y mainly reflecting the contract expiry of low margin abu dhabi volumes but up 4% q/q. this sequential momentum is driven by the combination of lower maintenance, the ramp-up of clov in angola and fewer disruptions in libya. in the downstream, total\\'s indicator margins confirmed a much stronger european refining environment in 3q and came in even higher than we were expecting with the margin three times the level of last year and last quarter. the third quarter is, in our view, likely to be the start of a turning point for total with earnings and free cash set to continue to grow from here. the start and ramp up of eight major projects over the next 18 months should be, on our analysis, enough by itself to secure this growth and when combined with an aggressive operating cost discipline programme the increase in free cash flow looks set to be one of the most impressive of the european oils sector. we rate the shares overweight with a eur62/sh price target.\\r\\n\\r\\nupstream \\xad turning point for production growth: we forecast 3q volumes of 2.14mboe/d down 7% y/y but 4% higher q/q (total basis). the sequential increase in volumes reflects lower maintenance, the ramp-up of clov in angola and fewer disruptions in libya. while natural gas realisations came in slightly stronger than expected, liquids realisations were lower and underperformed the move down in brent. overall we forecast operating profit of us$4.8bn, down 19% y/y and flat q/q.\\r\\n\\r\\ndownstream \\xad best margin environment for seven quarters: total\\'s 3q14 indicator ermi margin was $29.9/t, almost three times higher than last quarter and last year. total\\'s sensitivity of u$80m p.a. to a us$/1/tonne movement in the margin and this suggests a q/q increase in refining operating profit of cus$380m. with our expectation that the company should be able to capture most of this benefit and earnings likely flat q/q in the supply and trading business, we forecast a combined downstream operating profit of $1,116m, up 44% q/q and 20% higher y/y.\\r\\n\\r\\ntotf.pa: financial and valuation metrics eps usd\\r\\n\\r\\nfy

for the industry coverage universe as positive, neutral or negative (see definitions below). a rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.\\r\\nstock rating\\r\\noverweight - the stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.\\r\\nequal weight - the stock is expected to perform in line with the
