      "[TextBlock(text=\"Here are the key points from the analyst report on McCormick & Company:\\n\\n1. Earnings Beat: McCormick reported fiscal Q3 2009 earnings of $0.57 per share, beating the consensus estimate by $0.03. Revenues grew 4.6% year-over-year, roughly in line with the analyst's estimate.\\n\\n2. Valuation and Price Target: The analyst believes McCormick's valuation has become more attractive, trading at 13.8x next-twelve-month EPS, below the industry average of 14.6x. The analyst has a new price target of $39 for December 2010, up from the previous target of $34.\\n\\n3. Organic Volume Concerns: The analyst remains concerned about McCormick's organic volume growth, as the important Consumer division saw a 2.4% year-over-year decline in organic volume for the third consecutive quarter. The analyst believes McCormick may need to increase marketing spending to drive volumes higher.\\n\\n4. Walmart and Pensions: McCormick provided clarity on two key issues - the Walmart relationship and pension impacts. The company said Walmart is testing both private label and exclusive McCormick shelf sets, which could benefit McCormick if the exclusive sets are successful. For pensions, the company expects a $0.05-$0.07 hit in fiscal 2010.\\n\\n5. Investment Opportunity Assessment: The analyst maintains a Neutral rating, as they do not yet see sufficient upside to warrant a more positive stance. However, the valuation has become more attractive, and the clarity on Walmart and pensions is appreciated.\\n\\n6. Risks and Opportunities: Potential upside catalysts include Walmart going 100% McCormick core spices, an economic recovery driving higher-margin sales, and successful new product launches. Downside risks include Walmart going 100% private label, continued consumer weakness, and new product failures.\\n\\nOverall, the analyst sees a mixed outlook for McCormick, with the valuation appearing more attractive but concerns remaining around organic volume growth. The company's relationship with Walmart and pension impacts are key factors to monitor going forward.\", type='text')]\n"
