Following the company's strong fiscal 3Q09 yesterday (McCormick beat by $0.03), we reiterate our Neutral rating, as we do not yet see sufficient upside. We also remain concerned about organic volume trends. The valuation has become more attractive, and we appreciate the clarity provided by management about the two biggest overhangs on the name: Walmart and pensions.
 Beating the Street. McCormick reported a $0.57 fiscal 3Q09 (August) yesterday, three pennies above the consensus estimate. Revenues grew by 4.6% year-on-year, roughly in line with our estimate of 4.4%. Though the gross margin came in a bit lighter than we had modeled (40.3% vs 40.7%), it nonetheless improved by 70 bps year-on-year. The majority of the beat came from the SG&A line, where cost savings reduced the SG&A margin by 40 bps y/y. Guidance was raised to the top end of the $2.31-$2.33 range ex-items.
 Clarity on Walmart and pensions. To McCormick's credit, management addressed two of the more important overhangs on the stock. For pensions, the company said that as of today it expects a $0.05-$0.07 hit in FY10 (this corresponds with our forecast -- contact us for a MKC pension model). Regarding Walmart, MKC said that WMT is not only testing shelf sets that are exclusively private label, but also sets that are exclusively McCormick for core spices/seasonings. If WMT likes what it sees from the latter test, then the changes from Project Impact could benefit McCormick.
 We remain concerned about organic volume growth. Organic (ex-acquisition) volume in the important Consumer division fell by 2.4% y/y in 3Q, the third consecutive decline. This came despite a deceleration in price growth to 2.5% from 3.5% y/y. With the benefits of pricing rolling off and the Lawry's acquisition having been lapped, McCormick needs to drive volumes higher. This may require, as the company suggested yesterday, even greater marketing spending.
 Valuation and price target. At 13.8x the consensus NTM EPS estimate, McCormick trails the group average by about 0.8x. We see no reason why MKC should trade above the group, but it probably shouldn't trade at much of a discount either. If we apply 14.6x (the group average) to our new FY11 EPS estimate of $2.68, we get fair value of $39 at the end of next year. Indeed, $39 is our new Dec10 price target (note that our old price target of $34 was for Dec-09).

Note: we continue to see risk to earnings from pensions in FY11 and beyond on an incremental basis; we do not think that the pension headwind necessarily ends in FY10.
Regarding Walmart, MKC said that WMT is not only testing shelf sets that are exclusively private label, but also sets that are exclusively McCormick (for core spices/seasonings). If WMT likes what it sees from the latter test, then the changes from Project Impact could benefit McCormick.

Upside: 1) Walmart may go 100% McCormick core spices; 2) the economy may turn around, thus driving more consumers back to higher mix items; 3) new products (as we discussed in a note two weeks ago) may drive sales higher than we expect.
Downside: 1) Walmart may go 100% private label core spices; 2) the consumer may continue to worsen, thus driving a lower mix; 3) new products may not succeed.
