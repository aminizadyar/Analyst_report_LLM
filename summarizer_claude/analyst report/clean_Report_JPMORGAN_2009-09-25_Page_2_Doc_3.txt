Post-Call: While Aug. Sales Pace Slowed for KBH, We Still Believe Industry Demand Still Slowly Reemerging
Following its 3Q09 (August-end) conference call, we provide the following key takeaways (pre-call bullets in the body of this note):
 Sales pace slows in August due to upcoming expiration of tax credit, however, we believe overall demand remains relatively stable, as per LEN's statement on Monday. While KBH noted that sales pace in August slowed due to the expiration of the $8K tax credit, as well as due to normal seasonality, in our view, we continue to expect positive YOY order growth in 4Q, at 8%, which reflects our view that the housing market should continue to improve on a YOY basis and continue to stabilize on a sequential basis. We note our 8% order growth estimate is based on community count down 39% YOY to 160 and an absorption pace of 8.8 orders per community, up 80% YOY. Also, importantly, we also point to LEN's recent comments, in which it stated that August trends improved and that September was consistent with August. As a result, we continue to believe the overall industry should experience positive YOY order growth in 4Q, which should in turn be a positive catalyst for the sector.
 3Q gross margins better than reported, given 130 bps hit from higher warranty reserve; moreover, KBH guides for 4Q gross margin expansion. Specifically, excluding a $6 mil. increase in its warranty liability related to Chinese drywall issues that affected 140 homes primarily in FL, KBH's gross margins in 3Q (excharges) would have been 15.9%, well above our 13.0%E. Regarding 4Q, while KBH did not give specific detail, it does expect both sequential and YOY expansion, albeit from 3Q's 14.6% (ex-impairments, but pre-warranty reserve). As a result, we estimate 4Q margin expansion of only 90 bps seq. to 15.5%, given still challenging market conditions, however, we believe upside potential does exist to our estimate.
 Land spend increases, albeit still expected to be down YOY. Specifically, KBH purchased lots across all regions, with land spend in 3Q totaling roughly $90 mil. For the year, KBH expects total land spend of $360 mil., down from last year's $500+ mil. Importantly, KBH noted that it is beginning to see more land deals that make economic sense, and continues to target finished lots with rolling options. Regarding its re-entry into Wash. DC, we believe this will be more of a gradual effort as KBH's team in the area has only begun to be assembled.
 JV debt continues to fall. KBH ended 3Q with $172 mil. invested in 16 JVs, roughly in line with 2Q's $171 mil. invested, but in 19 JVs; the JVs had $562 mil. of total debt, vs. 2Q's $740 mil., and $1.0 bil. in assets vs. 2Q's $1.1 bil.

 Maintain Overweight rating and $25.50 Dec. 2010 Price Target. Trading at 0.97x P/B (ex-adjusted FAS 109 charges), a 9% discount to its larger-cap peers' 1.07x, we believe KBH's valuation is attractive given its impressive value-engineering efforts via its Open Series community program, our above-average 2H09 order growth outlook relative to its peers, and solid cash position. Thus we rate the stock Overweight. Regarding our price target analysis, we apply a 1.66x P/B multiple to our 2010-end book value estimate of $16.75 (ex-adjusted FAS 109) to reach a December 2010 price target of $25.50. Our 1.66x P/B multiple is based on a 10% premium to KBH's historical 10-year P/B multiple, which we believe is appropriate at this point in the cycle, given our outlook for housing to continue to recover over the next 24 months.

3Q Orders Well Above Our Estimate, Gross Margins Solidly Ahead; Reiterate OW Rating KBH reported 3Q (Aug-end) results featuring orders up 62%, well above our 20%E, as well as impairment charges of $48 mil., or a 4.5% hit to equity, below our $57 mil. estimate (or a 5.3% hit to equity). Importantly, while 3Q's year-ago order comp was easy, at -66% YOY, we point out that KBH's absorption pace at roughly 15 orders per community (assuming flattish community count growth), places the company 74% above the 8.6 3Q average from 2006 to 2008, and only modestly below the range of 18 to 22 from 2001 to 2005. As such, we believe this indicates that demand has begun to slowly re-emerge, as well as the builders starting to gain traction from their value-engineering efforts. Moreover, core operating margins (excharges), while still negative, improved to -3.9% from last quarter's -6.4%, and were above our -5.0%E, driven by better than expected gross margins. Accordingly, we reiterate our Overweight rating on KBH amid our positive sector stance.
 Orders rise strongly, well above our estimate, and in sharp contrast to last quarter's solid decline. Specifically, orders rose 62% YOY, well above our 20%E and were in sharp contrast to last quarter's 31% YOY decline. Regionally, the rise was led by the Southeast, up 124% YOY, following last quarter's 62%
decline, while the West and Central rose 64% and 60% following last quarter's 5% decline and 9% rise, respectively. Additionally, the Southwest rose 26% following last quarter's 53% decline. While order ASPs of $182K fell 28% YOY and 14% seq., we note that given the relatively low level of impairment charges this quarter, we do not believe this was driven by material price deterioration, but rather mix shift and value- engineering efforts as its Open Series communities continue to become a greater percentage of its overall business. Lastly, while its can rate rose modestly to 27% from last quarter's 20%, we note it was down solidly from last year's 51%. Moreover, we do not believe this rise in can rate to be a material concern, given can rates typically rise 5-10% in 3Q for the industry.
 Impairment charges below our estimate. KBH reported land charges of $48 mil., including $25 mil. of land impairments and $23 mil. of JV charges, representing a 4.5% hit to equity (after-tax), below our $57 mil. estimate, or 5.3% of equity. Given 3Q's strong rise in orders, we believe KBH's charges should continue to moderate over the next few quarters as its absorption and order rates continue to improve.
 Core margins remain negative, but continue to improve solidly, and were better than our estimate. While core margins of -3.9% remained negative, we note they were better than our -5.0%E, as well as 2Q's -6.4% and 3Q08's -10.3%. Specifically, gross margins (ex-charges) of 14.6%, ahead of our 13.0%E, rose 190 bps seq. and 500 bps YOY, while its SG&A ratio of 18.5%, slightly higher than our 18.0%E, fell 60 bps seq. and 140 bps YOY.
 Lastly, while cash position down slightly, it remains solid, in our view. KBH ended 3Q with $1.06 bil. of cash, down only slightly from 2Q's $1.10 bil., while its net debt-to-cap rose to 55.2%, up 790 bps seq. and 1,000 bps YOY. While cash was down slightly, we believe this was partially driven by the company beginning to reinvest in its business and point to it re-entering the Wash. DC market, which likely required startup capital in the quarter.
Trading at 0.97x P/B (ex-adjusted FAS 109 charges), a 9% discount to its larger-cap peers' 1.07x, we believe KBH's valuation is attractive given its impressive valueengineering efforts via its Open Series community program, our above-average 2H09 order growth outlook relative to its peers, and solid cash position. Thus we rate the stock Overweight.
Regarding our price target analysis, we apply a 1.66x P/B multiple to our 2010-end book value estimate of $16.75 (ex-adjusted FAS 109) to reach a December 2010 price target of $25.50. Our 1.66x P/B multiple is based on a 10% premium to KBH's historical 10-year P/B multiple, which we believe is appropriate at this point in the cycle, given our outlook for housing to continue to recover over the next 24 months.
We believe the following factors present risks to our Overweight rating and price target on KBH, and could spur underperformance relative to the group: 1) weaker than expected order growth; 2) greater than expected impairment charges; and 3) lower than expected margin and sales benefits from its Open Series communities.
